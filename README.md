# ICML2024-Accelerated-Policy-Gradient-for-s-rectangular-Robust-MDPs-with-Large-State-Spaces

These are python codes for the ICML 2024 paper titled "Accelerated Policy Gradient for s-rectangular Robust MDPs with Large State Spaces".

Run "FasterPG_robustRL_SmallSpace_main.py", you will see a new folder called "SmallSpaceResults", which contains the result figure and hyperparameters for small state space (see Appendix O1 of this paper). 

Run "FasterPG_robustRL_BigSpace_main.py", you will see a new folder called "BigSpaceResults", which contains the result figure and hyperparameters for large state space (see Appendix O2 of this paper).
